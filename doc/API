Commands: GetId, SetColor, UpdateAccel

GetId: The GetId command returns an Id used by the client to identify himself.
This UUID will be included in all Set and Update request by the client and is only
valid per session and will be purged from the buffer after 600 seconds.
The GetId should also be considered to be used for XSRF if required.

Request:
"id": ""

Response:
"id": "$(GENERATED_UUID)"



SetColor: After the GetId returned a UUID for the client, the client can
set their color to start playing. The client will use a color chooser.

Request:
"id": "$(UUID)",
"color": "$(HEXVALUE)"

Response:
"id": "$(UUID)",
"message": "SetColor successful."



UpdateAccel: After setting their color, the client starts sending updates
from the device accelerometer, these updates should only occur every 1000 ms.
Maybe setting the update interval to 500 ms will work too, but this depends
on the queue/buffer handling on the backend.

Request:
"id": "$(UUID)",
"xaxis": "FIXME x-axis position",
"yaxis": "FIXME y-axis position",
"zacis": "FIXME z-axis position"

Response:
"id": "$(UUID)",
"message": "UpdateAccel inserted."
